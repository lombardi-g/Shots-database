# Shots database for Figueirense youth categories
Repository containing VBA files to automate my insertion of lines on a database.<br>
The goal of this project is to study and analyze how the youth categories of Figueirense FC are finishing their plays, and how the opposition achieves their finishes.

By building a robust enough database, it becomes possible to examine performance metrics and patterns.
