# Shots database for Figueirense youth categories
Repository containing VBA files to automate my insertion of lines on a database.

Developed during data analytics internship at the football club.

The goal of this project is to study and analyze how the youth categories of Figueirense FC are finishing their plays, and how the opposition achieves their finishes.

By building a robust enough database, it becomes possible to examine performance metrics and patterns.
